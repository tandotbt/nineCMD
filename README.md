## What is 9CMD?

With the desire to continue the process of exploring the world Nine Chronicles on my iPhone 6 device, and other devices as long as the Chrome browser installed :v

## How to use?

You will need to deploy a self-hosting server [Nine_CMD_sign](https://github.com/tandotbt/Nine_CMD_sign) or use the server I deployed to test at [ninecmd.pythonanywhere.com](https://ninecmd.pythonanywhere.com/)

A better option is to use [Chrono](https://nine-chronicles.dev/general/chrono/how-to-use-chrono)!
